# Incident Response Plan

Cyber security incidents can be high-pressure situations with serious consequences for both businesses and people alike. That stress can compromise decision making (especially when tired!) and a good cyber incident response plan helps organisations to get their response right.

This project contains a [template cyber IR plan](https://github.com/cydea/ir-plan/blob/master/ir-plan.md) for you to pick up and tailor to your organisation.


## Why?

While working with a client on improving their blue team and incident response capability they mentioned that they hadn’t been able to find an example of a good cyber incident response plan.

That came as a bit of a surprise, but they weren’t wrong. There are ‘how-tos,’ some thinly veiled vendor pitches, and plenty of other marketing materials. Some of it is old. Lots talk at a high level about the ‘phases’ of response. Many more are just ‘plans for a plan.’

There were a few notable exceptions - for example, the [NCSC incident management](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/incident-management) collection - though we struck out looking for a structured document to use as a base.

Given how critical responding to security incidents is we were surprised to not find a decent template to start from. So we set about researching, distilling and compiling all the best practice, augmented from our experience responding to some of the highest-profile cyber events in recent years.

It's now available for you to pick up and make your own.


## Usage

Make a copy of the [IR Plan Template](https://github.com/cydea/ir-plan/blob/master/ir-plan.md), or a copy of the [Google Docs version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TgokdcPm39CuFnYDQ9Hr57mhG4TFwm0Fa2ohxEmJZhg/edit?usp=sharing) and then spend some time on...

 - Who your key contacts are, and who deputises for them
 - Tailoring the severity levels and escalation criteria
 - Choosing the categories that you’ll assign to incidents
 
Then discuss it with your team and senior management, agree this is how you'll operate, and then try running a few exercises to test everyone knows how it works!

There is also a [PDF version of the template](https://github.com/cydea/ir-plan/blob/master/Incident-Response-Plan-(Template).pdf) available.
